- how to add a custom callback to button element.

</Alert>

## Overview

By default, the **Button** element comes with 2 workings action types out of the box:

- **Link**: useful to create a link to different web URL;
- **Scroll to element**: in case you want to scroll to a specific element within the page.

A third option is available, **Click handler**: this need a bit of work in order to function.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to add a custom button click handler, available to be used within the Page Builder.

## Register a new plugin

You need to register a new plugin for Page Builder and include it inside both `admin` and `website` packages.

Those are the files within you need to register your plugin:

- **Page Builder editor** plugins: `apps/admin/src/plugins/pageBuilder/editor.ts`
- **Page Builder render** plugins: `apps/admin/src/plugins/pageBuilder/render.ts`
- **Website Page Builder** plugins: `apps/website/src/plugins/pageBuilder.ts`

## Register a button handler
Now, go back to our custom plugin file to register a new button handler. 

This comes pretty easy: you just need to define a new plugin object with `type: pb-page-element-button-click-handler`, see the example here below:

```ts apps/plugins/button-click-handlers/editor.ts
export const buttonClickHandlers = [
    // Register a simple click handler that doesn't depend on any variables.
    {
        type: "pb-page-element-button-click-handler",
        name: "simple-handler",
        title: "A Simple Handler",
        // Once the button is clicked, we display a simple alert message.
        handler: () => {
            alert("I was clicked!");
        }
    }
]
```
As you can see, the configuration object has the following properties: 

- `type`: plugin type (`pb-page-element-button-click-handler`);
- `name`: the plugin name, this must be unique;
- `title`: shown in the Page Builder button configuration settings;
- `handler`: to define your custom button handler.

### Custom button handler with variables
You might need to allow your admin user to set one or more custom variables values and pass them to the handler. 

In this case, you just need to add a couple of more properties to our handler configuration object: 

```ts apps/plugins/button-click-handlers/editor.ts
import { PbButtonElementClickHandlerPlugin } from "@webiny/app-page-builder/types";

export const buttonClickHandlers = [
    // Register a click handler that depends on two variables (color and size).
    {
      type: "pb-page-element-button-click-handler",
      name: "handler-with-variables",
      title: "Handler With Variables",
      // Here are the variables that users will be able to set via the
      // button's "Action" settings (in the Page Builder editor).
      variables: [
        { name: "color", label: "My Color", defaultValue: "red" },
        { name: "size", label: "My Size", defaultValue: "XXL" }
      ],
      // Once the button is clicked, we simply log the received variables.
      handler: ({ variables }) => {
        console.log(variables); // Logs { color, size } object.
      }
    } as PbButtonElementClickHandlerPlugin<{ color: string; type: string }>
]
```

You are adding the following property:

- `variables`: a list of allowed variables with name, label and default values. Those will be received by your custom handler.

Now, your admin users are able to define custom values to predefined variables via the button's "Action" settings within the Page Builder.
