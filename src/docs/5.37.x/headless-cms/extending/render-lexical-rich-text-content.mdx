## What you'll learn
- How to render rich text Lexical editor content from Headless CMS in React

## Overview

Webiny uses Lexical editor [lexical.dev](https://lexical.dev) as a go to Rich Text Editor, with some additional plugins.
## Usage

Fetch your data from Headless CMS, then pass it to the component like this:

```tsx components/MyView.tsx
import { RichTextLexicalRenderer } from "@webiny/react-rich-text-lexical-renderer";

// Mount the component
<RichTextLexicalRenderer value={content} />;
```

## Adding your custom lexical nodes for rendering

You can add custom lexical nodes for rendering your content:

```tsx lexical/nodes/MyCustomNode.ts
import { ParagraphNode } from "lexical";
class MyCustomNode extends ParagraphNode {
    ...
}

// Mount the component
<RichTextLexicalRenderer value={content} nodes={[MyCustomNode]} />;
```

Please check [lexical docs](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/nodes), to learn more how create your custom nodes. 

## Modifying Typography Options

Modifying typography options that are displayed by the editor is performed at the theme level, via the theme object:

```tsx  app/theme.ts
const myTheme = {
    styles: {
        typography: {
            headings: [
                {
                    id: "custom_heading1",
                    name: "Custom Heading 1",
                    tag: "h1",
                    styles: { ...headings, fontWeight: "bold", fontSize: 48 }
                }],
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
}

// Mount the component
<RichTextLexicalRenderer value={content}  theme={myTheme} nodes={[MyCustomNode]} />;
```
