</Alert>

## Overview

Webiny uses Lexical editor [lexical.dev](https://lexical.dev) as a go to Rich Text Editor, with some additional plugins. To speed up the rendering of data for developers, we created this component.

## Install

```
npm install --save @webiny/react-rich-text-lexical-renderer
```

Or if you prefer yarn:

```
yarn add @webiny/react-rich-text-lexical-renderer
```

## Usage

Fetch your data from Headless CMS, then pass it to the component like this:

```tsx
import { RichTextRenderer } from "@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer";

// Load content from Headless CMS (here we show what your content might look like).
const content = {
    root: {
        children: [
            {
                children: [
                    {
                        detail: 0,
                        format: 0,
                        mode: "normal",
                        style: "",
                        text: "A well written paragraph of text can bring so much joy!",
                        type: "text",
                        version: 1
                    }
                ],
                direction: "ltr",
                styles: [],
                format: "",
                indent: 0,
                tag: "p",
                type: "paragraph-element",
                version: 1
            }
        ],
            direction: "ltr",
            format: "",
            indent: 0,
            type: "root",
            version: 1
    }
}

// Mount the component
<RichTextLexicalRenderer value={content} />;
```

## Adding your custom lexical nodes for rendering

You can add custom lexical nodes for rendering your content:

```tsx

class MyCustomNode extends SomeOtherNode {
    ...
}

// Mount the component
<RichTextLexicalRenderer value={content} nodes={[MyCustomNode]} />;
```

## Adding your custom typography theme.

You can override Webiny default typography theme that is used by lexical editor by providing your custom typography object.

Please [ read our docs ](https://www.webiny.com/docs/page-builder/theming/theme-object) before add you custom theme.
```tsx

const myTheme = {
    styles: {
        typography: {
            headings: [
                {
                    id: "custom_heading1",
                    name: "Custom Heading 1",
                    tag: "h1",
                    styles: { ...headings, fontWeight: "bold", fontSize: 48 }
                }]
        }
    }
}

// Mount the component
<RichTextLexicalRenderer value={content}  theme={myTheme} nodes={[MyCustomNode]} />;
```

## FAQ

### I'm not using React. How do I render this using other frameworks?

The rendering implementation is really simple and straightforward. You can find the [full code in our repo](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/react-rich-text-lexical-renderer/src/index.tsx). Using that as a reference, you can quickly put together a renderer in the framework of your choice.
