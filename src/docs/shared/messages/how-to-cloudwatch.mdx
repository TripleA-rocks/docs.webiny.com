From time to time, for debugging purposes, developers might need to access runtime logs for one or more [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions that Webiny deploys. The following steps show how to use [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to access logs for a specific AWS Lambda function.

1. Open [CloudWatch Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home).
2. Click on **Log groups** in the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the log group that corresponds to the function you want to view logs for. You can also use the search bar to quickly find the log group you're looking for. 
4. Click on the log stream that corresponds to the function you want to view logs for.
5. You should now see the logs for the Lambda function you selected.

### I can see multiple log groups for the same function. Which one should I use?

If you have multiple Webiny deployments in the same AWS account, you will see multiple log groups for the same function. The log group you're looking for is the one that corresponds to the deployment you want to view logs for.
