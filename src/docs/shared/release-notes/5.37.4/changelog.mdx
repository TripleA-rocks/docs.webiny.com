## Page Builder

### Fixed Deletion and Unpublishing of Pages (Multi-tenant Projects) ([#3528](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3528))

Prior to this release, in multi-tenant projects, when deleting or unpublishing a page, the page would not be fully deleted. More specifically, despite the fact that the page would not be visible in the Admin app, it would still be visible on the public website.

This has now been addressed. When deleting a page, it will be fully deleted, meaning the page will no longer be visible in the Admin app nor on the public website.
