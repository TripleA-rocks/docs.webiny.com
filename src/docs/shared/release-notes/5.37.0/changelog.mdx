## Security

### Introducing Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL) ([#2576](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2576))

The Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL) is the next step in the evolution of Webiny's existing security layer, which is now divided into three tiers. The higher the tier, the more features are available.

All Webiny project start with the **Open Source** tier. The tier is free to use, but, from now on, will be limited when it comes to defining fine-grained permissions, allowing only the **No Access** and **Full Access** to be selected when defining permissions for individual Webiny apps.

Trying to select **Custom Access** will result in an alert message being shown, informing the user that the feature is only available with the Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL), which is available on the **Business** and **Enterprise** tiers.

To upgrade to **Business** tier, users [link their project](/docs/wcp/link-a-project) with [Webiny Control Panel (WCP)](/docs/wcp/overview), from where they can activate the Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL) for their project. By doing this, users will be able to define fine-grained permissions for individual Webiny apps.

Finally, for the most advanced use cases, users can upgrade to the **Enterprise** tier. On top of the features available with the first two tiers, the **Enterprise tier** introduces the brand new **Teams** feature, enabling users to group users into teams and easily have them linked with one or more roles.

This feature is especially useful for larger organizations, where it's common to have multiple teams working on different projects. Also, it's a great way to simplify the process of managing permissions for multiple users, as you can simply assign a role to a team, instead of assigning it to each individual user.

#### A Note On Backwards Compatibility

The Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL) and the three tiers outlined above are a new concept introduced with this release. As such, it's important to note existing projects will not be affected by this change in any way.

More specifically, Webiny instances that were deployed prior to this release will still be able to rely on the mentioned **Custom Access** option upon defining permissions for individual Webiny apps, without having to upgrade to Business tier.

On the other side, unless the Business or Enterprise tier has been enabled, all newly deployed Webiny instances will automatically start with the **Open Source** tier. This means the **Custom Access** option will not be available upon defining permissions for individual Webiny apps. To enable this feature, users will have to upgrade to the Business or Enterprise tier. 


### Renaming Security Groups to Security Roles

With this release, we've renamed **Groups** to **Roles**. Essentially, this change was made in order for Webiny to be more aligned with industry standards. 

Note that this change is purely cosmetic and does not affect the functionality of the feature in any way. On levels such as the application code or Webiny's GraphQL API schema, the feature is still referred to as **Groups** and no breaking changes were introduced.
