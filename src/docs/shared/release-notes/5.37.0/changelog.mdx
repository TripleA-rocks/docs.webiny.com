## Security

### ✍️ Introducing Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL) ([#2576](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2576))

The Advanced Access Control Layer (AACL) is the next step in the evolution of Webiny's existing security layer, which is now divided into three tiers. The higher the tier, the more features are available.

All Webiny project start with the **open-source tier**. The tier is free to use, but, from now on, will be limited when it comes to defining fine-grained permissions, allowing only the No Access and Full Access to be selected when defining permissions for individual Webiny apps.
