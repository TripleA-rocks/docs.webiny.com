## Step-by-Step Guide

The following steps will guide you through the upgrade process. Please note that this guide assumes you are using the [new project setup](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/changelog#brand-new-project-setup), introduced with Webiny [5.29.0](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/changelog). In case you did not already migrate, please visit the [migration guide](/docs/release-notes/5.29.0/project-setup-migration).

### 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.37.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.37.0`.

### 2. Run the Upgrade Command

The next step is to run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade
```

### 3. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by redeploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

## Additional Notes

### Updating Your Custom API Plugins

As described in the changelog, there's now a new lifecycle event, [onTenantAfterInstall](./changelog#add-on-tenant-after-install-lifecycle-event-3377), which serves as a single, reliable place to hook into Webiny app installation for each tenant, and add things like initial data setup, etc. If you're currently using events like `pageBuilder.onSystemAfterInstall`, or `cms.onSystemAfterInstall`, we highly recommend updating your code to use the new event `tenancy.onTenantAfterInstall`.

The reason this is important to do is that, with the `5.37.0` release, we changed the order of app installation, and moved the Headless CMS app to be one of the first ones to be installed, because now File Manager depends on the Headless CMS. This change should only take a few moments to do, but it will make your system much more reliable, and future-proof.

Simply look for the `AfterInstall` string in your custom plugins to find all references to the legacy events, and modify the code to look something like this:

```ts
new ContextPlugin(context => {
  context.tenancy.onTenantAfterInstall.subscribe(() => {
    // All of your existing logic goes here.
  });
});
```
