## Page Builder

### Form Field Values Not Updating When Switching Between Page Elements ([#3478](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3478))

With the 5.37.0 release, a regression was introduced that affected the page editor.

When switching between page elements in the page editor, in the right sidebar, the form field values would not update to reflect the values of the newly selected element.

This issue has now been taken care of and the form field values will update as expected.

### Button Page Element Fixes ([#3479](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3479))

Two issues have been addressed with the Button page element.

First, in case the button was first used as a regular link to another page, and then the user decided to use the **Scroll to element** functionality instead, the button would not update to reflect the new functionality. Basically, the button would still behave as a regular link to another page.

Second, a similar issue was present when a user enabled **New tab** option upon setting up their button as a regular link to another page. Again, in case the user decided to use the **Scroll to element** functionality instead, the button would still open the link in a new tab, making the **Scroll to element** functionality unusable.

Both issues have been addressed and the button will now behave as expected.

### Bringing the Scroll to Element Feature Into the Lexical Editor ([#3474](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/3474))

Previously, the **Scroll to element** feature was only available with the Button page element.

With this release, the feature has been also11 brought into the Lexical editor.
