## Page Builder

### Migration Failure in Locale Without Page Entries (ddb + es setup) ([849c103](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/849c103858fa6eb5a5c9b17630d6f7c94b006515))

With 5.35.0 version we introduced the [Advanced Content Organisation for Page Builder](https://www.webiny.com/docs/release-notes/5.35.0/changelog#introducing-advanced-content-organization-for-page-builder): in order to work a data migration was needed and executed via the [Data Migration Lambda Function](https://www.webiny.com/docs/release-notes/5.35.0/changelog#data-migration-lambda-function-3079-3150). When dealing with a locale that lacked page entries, the migration process would fail.

We have resolved this migration bug. The fix ensures that in cases where a locale does not have any page entries (and the consequent empty Elasticsearch index), the migration process no longer encounters errors and proceeds smoothly.

<Alert type="warning">

The fix specifically targets instances where the migration failed due to this particular scenario. In case you experienced a migration failure, this has been marked as failed and will be re-run during Webiny project deploy.
